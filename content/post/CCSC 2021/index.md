## Collision

This April I had an amazing opportunity to attend one of the biggest tech conferences, **Collision**.  I was blown away at how well the conference was organized.  Not only did I get to hear from some incredible speakers, but the platform for viewing and interacting with the live sessions was great too.  Each of the three days was packed to the brim with speakers and presentations from different fields.

## Highlights

### Crypto and NFTs
  - Without a doubt two of the hottest topics in tech at the moment are cryptocurrency and NFTs.  It was great to listen in on differing opinions on the future of crypto, and how the investment space is changing.  I was also lucky enough to attend a talk with NBA player Spencer Dinwiddie, who is an investor in NBA TopShot.  TopShot in an online platform backed by the blockchain where basketball fans can buy, sell, and trade their favourite NBA moments as NFTs.  It was great to gain some insights on Dinwiddie's vision for TopShot, and how he thinks the sports industry and NFT market with interact.

### Data Driven Success
  - As a stats student I was pleased to hear how companies are turning big data into real insights.  This has been a talking point for many years now, and it's amazing to see how creative people can be when implementing their data.  I was especially excited to hear from Martin Wildberger of RBC, who discussed data handling and the role that tech plays in creating useful insights.

## Summary

It was great hear so many speakers from across the board at Collision.  I think my bigest takeway was the power of hearing from people outside of your specific field.  Especially when it comes to technology, there are so many people innovating in creative ways that can be applied to many different sectors.  Having them all in one place at Collision was an awesome expereince and I will surely be attending next year.
